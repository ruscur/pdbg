# PDBG

pdbg is a simple application to allow debugging of the host POWER
processors from the BMC. It works in a similar way to JTAG programmers
for embedded system development in that it allows you to access GPRs,
SPRs and system memory.

A remote gdb sever is under development to allow integration with
standard debugging tools.

## Building

The output of autoconf is not included in the git tree so it needs to be
generated using autoreconf. This can be done by running `./bootstrap.sh` in the
top level directory. Static linking is supported and can be performed by adding
`CFLAGS=-static` to the command line passed to configure.

### Cross compiling for BMC (ARM)

```
apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabi
./bootstrap.sh
./configure --host=arm-linux-gnueabi CFLAGS="-static"
make
rsync pdbg root@bmc:/usr/local/bin
```

Depending on your cross compile environment, you may get a message like
`pdbg: No such file or directory` when execting the binary on the BMC,
which may be fixable by correcting loader location:

`patchelf --set-interpreter /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3 pdbg`

## Usage

Several backends are supported depending on which system you are using and are
selected using the `-b` option:

POWER8 Backends:

- i2c (default): Uses an i2c connection between BMC and host processor
- fsi: Uses a bit-banging GPIO backend which accesses BMC registers directly via
  /dev/mem/. Requires `-d p8` to specify you are running on a POWER8 system.

POWER9 Backends:

- kernel (default): Uses the in kernel OpenFSI driver provided by OpenBMC
- fsi: Uses a bit-banging GPIO backend which accesses BMC registers directly via
  /dev/mem. Requiers `-d p9w/p9r/p9z` as appropriate for the system.
- sbefifo: Uses the in kernel OpenFSI & SBEFIFO drivers provided by OpenBMC

When using the fsi backend POWER8 AMI based BMC's must first be put into debug
mode to allow access to the relevant GPIOs:

`ipmitool -H <host> -U <username> -P <password> raw 0x3a 0x01`

On POWER9 when using the fsi backend it is also a good idea to put the BMC into
debug mode to prevent conflicts with the OpenFSI driver. On the BMC run:

`systemctl start fsi-disable.service && systemctl stop
host-failure-reboots@0.service`

Usage is straight forward. Note that if the binary is not statically linked all
commands need to be prefixed with LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=<path to libpdbg> in
addition to the arguments for selecting a backend.

### Target Selection

pdbg has commands that operate on specific hardware unit(s) inside the
POWER processor.  To select appropriate hardware unit (commonly referred
as **target**), pdbg provides two different mechanisms.

#### Select processor(s) / Core(s) / Thread(s) using -p/-c/-t/-a/-l

Many commands typically operate on hardware thread(s) or CPU(s)
as identified by Linux.

 - all threads (`-a`)
 - core 0 of processor 0 (`-p0 -c0`)
 - all threads on processor 0  (`-p0 -a`)
 - all threads on core 1 of processor 0 (`-p0 -c1 -a`)
 - thread 2 on core 1 of processor 0 (`-p0 -c1 -t2`)
 - thread 0 on all cores of processor 0 (`-p0 -t0 -a`)
 - threads 1,2,3,4 on cores 1,3,5 of processor 1 (`-p1 -c1,3,5 -t1-4`)
 - CPUs 15 and 17 as identified by Linux (`-l15,17`)

Note: `-l` option is only available when running `pdbg` on the host.

#### Select targets based on path using -P

To select any target in a device tree, it can be specified using `-P`.
The -P option takes path specification as an argument.  This path specification
is constructed using the *class* names of targets present in a device tree.

Some of the targets currently available for selection are:

 - `pib`
 - `core`
 - `thread`
 - `adu`
 - `fsi`
 - `chiplet`

Path specification can be either an individual target or a *path* constructed
using more than one targets.

 - all threads (`-P thread`)
 - core 0 of processor 0 (`-P pib0/core0`)
 - all threads on processor 0 (`-P pib0/thread`)
 - all threads on core 1 of processor 0 (`-P pib0/core1/thread`)
 - thread 2 on core 1 of processor 0 (`-P pib0/core1/thread2`)
 - thread 0 on all cores of processor 0 (`-P pib0/thread0`)
 - threads 1,2,3,4 on cores 1,3,5 of processor 1 (`-P pib1/core[1,3,5]/thread[1-4]`)
 - chiplet at address 21000000 (-P `chiplet@21000000`)
 - all adus (`-P adu`)
 - First FSI (`-P fsi0`)

                fsi:    An experimental backend that uses
                        bit-banging to access the host processor

                For I2C the device node used by the backend to access the bus.

Note that only selected targets (marked with *) and targets in the
hierarchy of the selected targets will be shown above. If none are shown
try adding '-a' to select all targets.
```

Core-IDs are core/chip numbers which should be passed as arguments to `-c`
when performing operations such as getgpr that operate on particular cores.
Processor-IDs should be passed as arguments to `-p` to operate on different
processor chips. Specifying no targets is an error and will result in the
following error message:

```
Note that only selected targets will be shown above. If none are shown
try adding '-a' to select all targets
```

If the above error occurs even though targets were specified it means the
specified targets were not found when probing the system.

Exploitation of HTM is limited to POWER8 Core from the powerpc host.

#### Prerequisites

Core HTM on POWER8 needs to run SMT1 and no power save, so you need to
run this first:
```
ppc64_cpu --smt=1
for i in /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpuidle/state*/disable;do echo 1 > $i;done
```
Also, using HTM requires a kernel built with both `CONFIG_PPC_MEMTRACE=y`
(v4.14) and `CONFIG_SCOM_DEBUGFS=y`. debugfs should be mounted at
`/sys/kernel/debug`. Ubuntu 18.04 has this by default.

#### How to run HTM

pdbg provides a `htm` command with a variety of sub-commands. The most
useful command is `record` which will start the trace, wait for buffer
to fill (~1 sec), stop and then dump the trace to a file (~5 sec). eg.
```
pdbg -l 0 htm core record
```
pdbg -l allows users to specify CPUs using the same addressing as
scheme as taskset -c. This can be useful for tracing workloads. eg.
```
taskset -c 0 myworkload
sleep 1
pdbg -l 0 htm core record
```
There are also low level htm commands which can also be used:
 - `start` will configure the hardware and start tracing in wrapping mode.
 - `stop` will still stop the trace and de-configure the hardware.
 - `dump` will dump the trace to a file.

### GDBSERVER
At the moment gdbserver is only supported on P8 while the cores are in the
kernel. 

To run a gdbserver on a P8 machine from a BMC running openbmc:

Stop all the threads of the core you want to look at
$ ./pdbg -d p8 -c11 -a stop

Run gdbserver on thread 0 of core 11, accessible through port 44
$ ./pdbg -d p8 -p0 -c11 -t0 gdbserver 44

On your local machine:
$ gdb
(gdb)  set architecture powerpc:common64
(gdb) target remote palm5-bmc:44

Debugging info:
(gdb) set debug remote 10


Notes:
1. DON'T RUN PDBG OVER FSI WHILE HOSTBOOT IS RUNNING. Weird things seem to
happen.
2. If you want to view the kernel call trace then run gdb on the vmlinux that
the host is running (the kernel needs to be compiled with debug symbols).
